SYNTAX

    export-acl [-scan <System.String[]] [-out <System.String>] [-depth <System.UInt32>] [-q <Switch>] [-style <System.String>] [-split <System.String>]

PREREQUISITES

    You need to have installed the RSAT tools on your computer, as this scripts uses some cmdlets included in those. 
    You need of course access rights to the directories you want to scan.
    The ImportExcel module is automatically imported if you do not have it installed.

DESCRIPTION

    This script parses the directories given and fetches all the access types linked to users or security groups. You can specify a single directory, or the path to a text file
    containing all the paths you want to scan. The list is exported in a single excel file, with one sheet per directory given as parameter.
    The path where to save the Excel file is given with the -out parameter. 
    You can also specify the recursive depth with the -depth parameter. The default is 1, and the minimum is 0(which is like typing "dir" or get-childitem)
