SYNOPSIS
    Exports the ACL of one or more folders to one or more Excel files.

SYNTAX

    .\export-acl.ps1 [-scan <System.String[]] [-out <System.String>] [-depth <System.UInt32>] [-q <Switch>] [-style <System.String>] [-split <System.String>] [-noninherited <Switch>] [-onlyusers <Switch>] [-fullnames <Switch>] [-nobuiltin <Switch>] [-nosystem <Switch>]

PREREQUISITES

    You need to have installed the RSAT tools on your computer, as this scripts uses some cmdlets included in those. 
    You need of course access rights to the directories you want to scan.
    The ImportExcel module is automatically imported if you do not have it installed.

DESCRIPTION

    This script parses the directories given and fetches all the access types linked to users or security groups. You can specify a single directory, or the path to a text file
    containing all the paths you want to scan. The list is exported in a single excel file, with one sheet per directory given as parameter.
    The path where to save the Excel file is given with the -out parameter. 
    You can also specify the recursive depth with the -depth parameter. The default is 1, and the minimum is 0(which is like typing "dir" or get-childitem)

        .\export-acl.ps1 -scan M:\path\to\directory -out C:\document.xlsx

----2. exports all ACL from the listed folders in the text file, including childfolders and grand childfolders. One Excel file, with one Worksheet per listed folder
        .\export-acl.ps1 -scan C:\path\to\list.txt -out C:\document.xlsx

----3. same as above, but add one recursivity level (default is 1), and disable output on the host console
        .\export-acl.ps1 -scan C:\path\to\list.txt -out C:\document.xlsx -depth 2 -q

----4. Export all ACL from one folder and its descendants, and add style Medium 3 to the pivottable
        .\export-acl.ps1 -scan M:\path\to\directory -out C:\document.xlsx -style Medium3

----5. Export all ACL from the folders listed in txt file, but decreases recursivity to one level (same result as dir command), with one excel file per listed folder
        .\export-acl.ps1 -scan C:\path\to\list.txt -out C:\directory -split -depth 0

----6. Export all non inherited ACL from one folder with a large recursivity, printing the fullnames instead of logins, excluding SYSTEM and BUILTIN accounts from the report.
        .\export-acl.ps1 -scan M:\path\to\directory -out C:\document.xlsx -depth 5 -noninherited -fullnames -nobuiltin -nosystem
